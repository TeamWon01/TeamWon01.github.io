                Educe.club is a web application built with React and hosted on an AWS stack that allows users to capture, classify, and share 
                insights similar to Google Keep. Currently, Educe has an MVP and are working with beta users to gather feedback to improve our product. 
                They have developed a roadmap based on user feedback and are seeking a team of developers to help accelerate the release of 
                our product into production
            </p>
            <p>
                The scope of the project includes several major features, such as enhancing the web responsive UX to align with standard UX best 
                practices, improving the insight creation experience by associating source links and embedding rich media, and adding group 
                collaboration and management capabilities. Our group plans  to enhance public vs private capabilities, create a non-authenticated 
                landing page with trending publicly shared insights, and implement a reader view for users to create a playlist-like experience 
                to view and interact with their insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Educe plans plan to integrate with other platforms such as social media sites (Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc.) and allow 
                users to share their insights on websites through an embed feature. We also plan to create an analytics dashboard to provide users
                with insights into their usage patterns.
